= Using the Chrome AsciiDoc preview extension

NOTE: The extension is named _Asciidoctor.js Live Preview_ and is also available for Firefox, but there are known issues.

If you have ever used asciidoctor to generate a preview of an `adoc` file, you might be interested in this Chrome extension.
It provides a _native_ asciidoctor preview in your browser without generating a `html` file.
You can also use it to preview files from GitHub and GitLab.

.Prerequisites

* Chrome browser
* an AsciiDoc file

== Installing the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview extension in Chrome

After installing the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview extension, you can test it out with files on GitHub.

. Install the extension from the link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia[chrome web store].

. Check that it is working by browsing the following file on GitHub:
+
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhataccess/pantheon/master/pantheon-bundle/src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/docs/assemblies/assembly-pantheon-help.adoc[Pantheon Help].
+
You should be able to toggle the rendering by clicking the extension icon in your chrome toolbar:

Note the following:
* The raw file contains the `include` statement to link the content required for this guide.
* The rendered content shows that included content.


== Configuring the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview extension

By default, Chrome extensions cannot _see_ files on your local hard disk.
You must give the extension that permission to use it for previewing content you are editing.

. Right click on the extension icon and choose *Options*.

The options listed are specific to this extension, see link:https://matthewsetter.com/technical-writing/tools/asciidoctor.js-live-preview-extension/set-custom-asciidoc-attributes/[example configuration] for more information.

. Dismiss the *Options* pop-up to reveal the extension configuration page.

. Enable *Allow access to file URLs* to enable access to your local files.

You can now drag and drop files onto your Chrome browser to preview content.
