:navtitle: Navigation

= Navigation using left hand menu

Antora supports navigation using a left hand menu, this is an AsciiDoc file that contains a list of items referenced by `xref`, for example:

----
* xref:index.adoc[Home]
** xref:content.adoc[]
** xref:navigation.adoc[]
----

* The default text displayed is the title of the referenced file.
* You can define an `navtitle` attribute in the referenced file to overwrite the displayed value.
* You can overwrite the displayed by specifying text in the xref.

This helps support two conflicting requirements:

* Long titles that support SEO to bring readers to the exact content they requirement.
* Short titles for readers who are familiar with the content and want to navigate by keyword.


[NOTE]
====
The `navtitle` attribute must be defined before the title of the page, for example:

----
:navtitle: Install

= Installing the doohickey in the thingamabob using widgets

----
